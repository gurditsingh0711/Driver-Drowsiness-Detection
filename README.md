# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection

A driverâ€™s drowsiness is one of the chief reasons for vehicular accidents that amount to casualties. Driving for a prolonged period of time tends to tire the driver causing fatigue and drowsiness. Several surveys and studies have held driver drowsiness responsible for many road disasters. It is crucial to have a system or a mechanism to curb this predominant issue. In a report published by the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, India, 4,552 such accidents were reported which proved fatal for drivers and passengers. Many truckers who are bound to drive at night become susceptible to accidents because of fatigue and drowsiness. Detection of drowsiness till date has been based on physiological and vehicular factors. Heartbeat, pulse rate and electrocardiogram are some physiological methods used to detect fatigue whereas vehicular methods involve acceleration pattern analysis, steering control movements. In order to develop a solution for the same work has been done on behavioral methods as well. A solution has been floated to capture real-time images followed by detection of drowsiness by using artificial intelligence techniques.
